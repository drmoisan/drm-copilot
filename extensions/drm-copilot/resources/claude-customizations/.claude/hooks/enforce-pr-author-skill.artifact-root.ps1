.SYNOPSIS
    Artifact-root resolution and the Check 1 body-path binding for enforce-pr-author-skill.ps1 (issue #850).

.DESCRIPTION
    Dot-sourced by enforce-pr-author-skill-helpers.ps1 after its module imports. Holds:

    - Resolve-PrAuthorArtifactRoot, which resolves once per call the worktree whose
      artifacts/ tree the gate reads: the epic checkpoint's worktree under epic scope, or
      the item worktree identity resolution selects. The PR context summary, the body, and
      the receipt are composed beneath that root, so a gate running in the session worktree
      no longer reads another item's artifacts from its own process directory.
    - Get-PrAuthorBodyPathBindingReason, the Check 1 binding: a relative canonical
      --body-file value is accepted only when the resolved worktree is the session worktree,
      because gh reads a relative path from its own process directory; an absolute value is
      accepted only when it equals the canonical path beneath the resolved root.
    - Test-PrAuthorBodyPathEqual and Get-PrAuthorEpicArtifactRoot, the pure path helpers.

.NOTES
    PowerShell 7+. Depends, at call time, on Get-PrAuthorBodyFileValue and
    Get-PrAuthorTargetCheckpointResolution from the helpers file and on the worktree-resolution
    modules it imports. It reads no file. Mirrored byte-identically under
    extensions/drm-copilot/resources/claude-customizations/.

        Resolve, once per call, the worktree whose artifacts the gate reads (issue #850).

        Epic scope: the root is the worktree holding the epic checkpoint, and a relative body
        path is allowed only when that root is the session worktree. Otherwise the item target
        is resolved by identity; an unresolved target returns its resolution reason unchanged,
        and a relative body path is allowed only for a SessionRoot target.

        The Bash command text under evaluation.

        System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary with Reason, ArtifactRoot,
        CheckpointPath, EpicScope, Status, and RelativeBodyAllowed.

        Reads the value once through Get-PrAuthorBodyFileValue. A relative

        value is accepted only when it equals that canonical path under Test-PrAuthorBodyPathEqual.
        Any other value, including no readable value, denies with the generic text.
    .PARAMETER CommandText
        The Bash command text under evaluation.

        The resolved worktree root the artifacts are read beneath.
    .PARAMETER RelativeBodyAllowed
