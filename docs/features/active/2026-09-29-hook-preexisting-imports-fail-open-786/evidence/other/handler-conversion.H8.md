# Handler Conversion H8

Timestamp: 2026-10-10T00-24
Command: R-RESET P8-T8#1; R-INSTALL group P8-T8#1 (.claude/hooks/validate-orchestrator-output.ps1 with .claude/hooks/validate-orchestrator-output-resolution.ps1, one group, smoke pass); section 2.6.6 H8 rows applied to tests/scripts/claude-hooks/validate-orchestrator-output.WaveBarrier.Tests.ps1; rcopy of both files to the Claude mirror; R-SCOPED over tests/scripts/claude-runtime/hook-dependency-guard-completeness.Tests.ps1, tests/scripts/claude-hooks/hook-dependency-failure.Claude.Tests.ps1, tests/scripts/claude-hooks/hook-import-failure-exemptions.FailClosed.Tests.ps1 (proof file), tests/scripts/claude-hooks/validate-orchestrator-output.WaveBarrier.Tests.ps1, and tests/scripts/claude-hooks/validate-orchestrator-output-resolution.Tests.ps1 (the H7 2.6.6 file, re-run for the shared hook); R-LINES; remnant search; R-EXIT1
EXIT_CODE: 0
Output Summary: Section 2.6.5 applied to H8. (i) The comment, init line, and try for OrchestratorStateEpicWaveBarrier.psm1 in the hook are replaced by one 2.2(b) line. (ii) The init line is deleted. (iii) The consumer block at validate-orchestrator-output-resolution.ps1:294-297 is deleted; the port-failure paths keep `$script:OrchestratorOutputUnevaluableToken` (3 matches in the sibling). install-log.md records INSTALL-RESULT: OK for P8-T8#1; mirror-log.md records `equal` for both files. 782 passed and 0 failed: the H7 and H8 proof rows pass, all tests of both 2.6.6 files pass, and, for the shared hook .claude/hooks/validate-orchestrator-output.ps1 (the [P8-T7] clause checked here), the six S1 to S6 repository and mirror rows and every B1, B2, and B3 row pass. `OrchestratorOutputWaveBarrierImportFailure` returns 0 matches in both files and both mirrors. R-EXIT1 for the hook equals BASE (1 = 1).
