.SYNOPSIS
    Pre-tool-use hook that gates git worktree remove behind parallel checkpoint merge state.

.DESCRIPTION
    Invoked by the Claude Code PreToolUse hook on the "Bash" matcher before any Bash
    command runs. Regex-matches git worktree remove against the envelope's tool_input.command,
    extracts the target worktree path argument, reads
    artifacts/orchestration/parallel-orchestrator-state.json, and finds the items[] record
    whose worktree_path matches. Allows removal only when that record's merge_status is
    merged or worktree_removed. Denies with reason PARALLEL_WORKTREE_REMOVAL_BLOCKED when
    the checkpoint is unreadable, no matching record exists, or merge_status is anything
    else - fail-closed, following the enforce-epic-worktree-removal-gate.ps1 precedent of
    treating an unreadable/no-match checkpoint as deny.

    Adapted from enforce-epic-worktree-removal-gate.ps1. The command interception regexes
    and the path normalization are unchanged; the checkpoint path, the read seam name, and
    the record collection differ, because the parallel surface records per-item state in
    items[] rather than features[]. A parallel run has no integration branch: each item
    opens its own pull request against main, so a removed worktree is unrecoverable work
    unless that item's own merge has been durably confirmed.

    Issue #690: each checkpoint is read beneath the live worktree whose run checkpoint
    records the removal target under worktree_path. An ambiguous target denies before any
    allow; when neither kind resolves, the deny names TARGET_WORKTREE_NOT_DERIVABLE.

.NOTES
    Compatible with PowerShell 7+. Depends on WorktreeRunResolution.psm1 (issue #690),
    imported inside a guard: a failed import is recorded and the decision denies naming
    the module. Filesystem reads go through injectable wrapper functions so tests can
    mock the boundary without writing temporary files.
