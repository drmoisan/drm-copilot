# cleanup_worktrees_detached_lib.sh: sourceable function group for detached-HEAD
# worktree registrations in the cleanup-worktrees tool. A branch-backed worktree is
# classified by branch name through classify_branch; a detached registration has no
# branch to classify, so this library classifies it on its own HEAD SHA and reports it
# as the five-field record WORKTREE|<path>|DETACHED|<state>|<flags>. The branch-backed
# four-field record WORKTREE|<path>|<branch>|<flags> is unchanged; the detached record
# replaces it for a detached registration rather than adding a second line.
#
# Sourcing contract: this file defines functions only; it never runs work at source
# time, so the wrapper and the bats suites can source it without side effects. It MUST
# be sourced after cleanup_worktrees_enumerate_lib.sh and cleanup_worktrees_lib.sh in
# every context, and additionally after cleanup_worktrees_actions_lib.sh in any context
# that calls remove_detached_worktree or apply_detached_worktrees, because it calls
# cleanup_wt_git, parse_worktree_list, normalize_wt_path, compute_protected, the four
# classification ladder rungs (classify_ancestry, classify_content_neutral,
# classify_cherry_equivalent, classify_residual_commit), and remove_worktree_safe. Bash
# resolves function names at call time, so run_report and run_apply may call into this
# file even though scripts/bash/cleanup-worktrees.sh sources it last.
#
# Git exit-code capture rule: every git-backed read is captured in the PARENT shell with
# `|| rc=$?` and fails closed, matching the invariant documented at
# scripts/bash/cleanup_worktrees_actions_lib.sh:19-35. A hard git failure always maps to
# the ANCESTRY_ERROR state and a non-zero return, never to a MERGED_* verdict and never
# to a removal.
#
# Deliberate non-reuse of classify_branch: its worktree lookup matches on branch name,
# and a detached record's branch field is the literal DETACHED, so the caller's own
# detached worktree would escape PROTECTED_CURRENT. It also emits into the BRANCH|
# namespace and can fabricate SHA-keyed COMMIT| records that cherry_pick_candidates
# would misread. Protection for a detached candidate is therefore decided BY NORMALIZED
# PATH against compute_protected's protected-path| records, and only the four ladder
# rungs (which accept a bare committish) are reused.
#
# Detached state vocabulary, exactly one token per classification:
#   MERGED_CLEAN | MERGED_CONTENT_NEUTRAL | MERGED_EQUIVALENT | NOT_MERGED |
#   HAS_UNIQUE_RESIDUALS | PROTECTED_CURRENT | ANCESTRY_ERROR
# The first three are the delete-eligible allowlist. Removal is never forced and
# `git worktree prune` is never invoked by this tool.
