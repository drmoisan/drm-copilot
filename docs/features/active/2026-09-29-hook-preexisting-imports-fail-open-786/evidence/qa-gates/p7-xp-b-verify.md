# Chunk XP-B Mirrors and Verification ([P7-T4])

Timestamp: 2026-10-10T00-13
Command: rcopy (rule 6) of the nine files edited in [P7-T3] to extensions/drm-copilot/resources/codex-and-agents-customizations/; R-SCOPED over tests/scripts/claude-runtime/hook-dependency-guard-completeness.Tests.ps1 and tests/scripts/codex-hooks/hook-dependency-failure.Codex.Tests.ps1; per-hook acceptance counts computed from the R-SCOPED output against wedges.csv and wruntime.csv (codex surface)
EXIT_CODE: 1
ExpectedExitCode: 1
Output Summary: mirror-log.md records `equal` for all nine copies (UNEQUAL: 0). For each XP-B hook (none is in W-CONVERT-HOOKS) the six S1 to S6 mirror rows are on PASSED: lines, no FAILED: line names the hook, the B1 PASSED count equals W-EDGES rows minus W-EXEMPT-EDGES rows plus distinct W-RUNTIME targets, and the B2 and B3 rows are on PASSED: lines (CHUNK-RESULT: OK). The X1 and X2 rows for .codex/hooks/enforce-epic-wave-barrier.ps1 and the X3 row for validate-bash are on PASSED: lines. The 17 remaining failures name only the XS hooks (.codex/hooks/validate-codex-subagent-routing.ps1, .codex/hooks/validate-feature-review-coverage.ps1) and the W-CONVERT-HOOKS hook .claude/hooks/validate-orchestrator-output.ps1, as expected.
