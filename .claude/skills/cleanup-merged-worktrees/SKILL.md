# Cleanup Merged Worktrees

Drive the end-to-end cleanup of stale git worktrees and branches after their work has
merged into `main`. The deterministic classification, consolidation staging, and
deletion mechanics live in `scripts/bash/cleanup-worktrees.sh` (wrapping
`scripts/bash/cleanup_worktrees_lib.sh` and
`scripts/bash/cleanup_worktrees_actions_lib.sh`). This skill owns the editorial and
orchestration layer: deciding whether flagged unique content is genuinely
documentation/memory material, driving consolidation onto a single
`documentationandmemories` branch, delegating PR creation to `Agent(pr-author)`, and
running the destructive apply pass only after the consolidation PR has merged.

The script is deterministic and owns the safe/unsafe decision; the LLM/editorial
judgment (which flagged commits are documentation/memory content) is this skill's job
and is out of the script's scope.

## When to Use This Skill

- After an epic or feature's PRs have all merged and two to five stale
  `drm-copilot-wt-*` branches or worktrees remain.
- When you need a trustworthy, machine-parseable report of which branches/worktrees are
  safe to delete (`MERGED_CLEAN`, `MERGED_CONTENT_NEUTRAL`, `MERGED_EQUIVALENT`) versus
  which carry unmerged or unique work (`NOT_MERGED`, `HAS_UNIQUE_RESIDUALS`).
- When stranded documentation/agent-memory commits were appended to a worktree branch
  after its feature content already merged and must be preserved before deletion.
- When a worktree is reported `BLOCKED-DIRTY`, or its branch is classified `NOT_MERGED`
  or `HAS_UNIQUE_RESIDUALS`, and the uncommitted or unmerged content it holds must be
  triaged into disposable versus must-preserve before the worktree can ever be deleted.
- Do not use this skill to manage remote branches; its scope is local branches and
  local worktree registrations only, except for the explicitly confirmed origin-branch
  offer in the Dirty Worktree Triage Procedure's final step.

## Report Line Contract

The script emits pipe-delimited, `LC_ALL=C`-ordered records, one per line:

- `BRANCH|<name>|<state>` — `state` in `NOT_MERGED | MERGED_CLEAN |
  MERGED_CONTENT_NEUTRAL | MERGED_EQUIVALENT | HAS_UNIQUE_RESIDUALS | PROTECTED_CURRENT`.
- `COMMIT|<branch>|<sha>|<state>|<paths-csv>|<author>|<author-date>` — per-commit state
  in `EQUIVALENT | CONTENT_ON_MAIN | EMPTY | UNIQUE | CONFLICT`. A `UNIQUE` COMMIT record
  is a cherry-pick candidate for editorial triage.
- `WORKTREE|<path>|<branch-or-DETACHED>|<flags>` — worktree registrations.
- `WORKTREE|<path>|DETACHED|<state>|<flags>` — a detached-HEAD worktree registration,
  classified on its own HEAD SHA. This five-field record replaces the four-field record
  above for a detached registration; it is not emitted in addition to it. `state` is one
  of `MERGED_CLEAN | MERGED_CONTENT_NEUTRAL | MERGED_EQUIVALENT | NOT_MERGED |
  HAS_UNIQUE_RESIDUALS | PROTECTED_CURRENT | ANCESTRY_ERROR`, where `ANCESTRY_ERROR` is
  the fail-closed verdict for a hard git failure at any rung of the classification. The
  fifth field carries the porcelain flag set unchanged, so the `locked` and `prunable`
  markers are preserved in the record.
- `WARN|main-divergence|<local-sha>|<origin-sha>` — local `main` differs from
  `origin/main` (advisory; classification still runs).
- `DIRTY|<worktree-path>|<status-porcelain-line>` — a dirty worktree that blocked
  removal. This record is apply mode only, and its three-field shape is unchanged by the
  dirt classifier: the classifier adds the two records below rather than altering or
  replacing this one.
- `DIRTFILE|<worktree-path>|<verdict>|<detail>|<xy>|<file-path>` — one record per
  `git status --porcelain` entry in a dirty worktree, emitted by report mode in porcelain
  order immediately after that worktree's `WORKTREE|` record. `verdict` is exactly one of
  `DISPOSABLE_BUILD_ARTIFACT | DISPOSABLE_SESSION_ARTIFACT | CONTENT_ON_MAIN |
  CONTENT_IN_HISTORY | STAGED_TREE_IS_COMMIT | UNIQUE`, and no other verdict token is ever
  produced. `detail` carries the commit SHA that justifies the verdict for
  `STAGED_TREE_IS_COMMIT` and `CONTENT_IN_HISTORY`, and is empty for the other four
  verdicts. `xy` is the porcelain two-character status field, preserved verbatim including
  its space. The file path is the last field, so a path containing a pipe character cannot
  shift any later field. A classification read that fails maps its entry to `UNIQUE`: that
  is the fail-closed direction, because an entry the tool could not classify is treated as
  content that must be preserved. `DISPOSABLE_SESSION_ARTIFACT` matches three fixed
  repository paths under `artifacts/`, is repository-agnostic, and cannot fire in a checkout
  that gitignores `artifacts/` — which drm-copilot does at `.gitignore:6` — because the
  status read never carries `--ignored`; the verdict is retained for consumer checkouts
  where those paths are not ignored, and it must not be made reachable by adding
  `--ignored`.
- `DIRTSUM|<worktree-path>|<aggregate>|<detail>` — exactly one record per dirty worktree,
  emitted by report mode immediately after that worktree's `DIRTFILE|` records.
  `aggregate` is `ALL_DISPOSABLE` if and only if the worktree has at least one status
  entry and none of them is `UNIQUE`, and `HAS_UNIQUE` otherwise. `detail` carries the
  first non-empty per-entry detail. A worktree with zero status entries emits neither this
  record nor any `DIRTFILE|` record. Both records are read-only: an `ALL_DISPOSABLE`
  aggregate unlocks nothing on its own, and clearing happens only when the operator
  supplies `--clear-disposable` in apply mode.

  Report-mode exit status. When a candidate worktree's `git status --porcelain` read
  fails, report mode emits no `DIRTFILE|` and no `DIRTSUM|` record for that worktree and
  returns git's non-zero exit code. A checkout containing such a worktree therefore exits
  non-zero from report mode where the same checkout previously exited 0 and produced a
  complete report. This is deliberate. A worktree whose status read failed produces no dirt
  records at all, so a report that also exited 0 would be indistinguishable from a report
  about a clean worktree, and an operator would make a deletion decision on silently
  incomplete data. The non-zero exit is the only channel that carries the incompleteness to
  a wrapping script. See the analogous apply-mode note in the End-to-End Workflow, where a
  blocked detached removal sets a non-zero exit status for the same reason.
- `ACTION|<verb>|<target>|<result>` — apply-mode action results.
- `ORPHAN_DIR|<path>|<size>` — a directory under a worktree-tracking root that carries
  no `.git` pointer file and no `git worktree list` entry. `<size>` is best-effort and
  may be the literal `unknown`. The record is advisory: it reports the directory, and
  nothing in apply mode acts on it. For the disposition, see the Dirty Worktree Triage
  Procedure's step 7, which governs how an orphaned directory is handled.
- `STALE_REF|<refname>` — a `refs/remotes/<name>/*` ref whose `<name>` is not a
  configured remote, named in full ref form. Advisory only; no ref is ever pruned by
  this tool.
- `CHILD_OF|<branch>|<ancestor>` — `branch` is a git ancestor of `ancestor`, and both
  resolved exactly `NOT_MERGED` through their own full ladders. It is emitted alongside,
  never instead of, the branch's own `BRANCH|<branch>|NOT_MERGED` line, and names the
  containment relationship so an operator can see that the branch's work is not lost
  when the named ancestor is retained.
- `WARN|registration-lost|<path>` — a worktree directory whose `.git` pointer file names
  a gitdir target that no longer exists. Git commands run inside such a directory fail
  in confusing ways. Advisory only.

## End-to-End Workflow

1. **Detect and report (dry run).** Run `bash scripts/bash/cleanup-worktrees.sh`
   (report mode is the default and mutates nothing). It verifies local `main` against
   `origin/main` (emitting `WARN|main-divergence` on drift), enumerates branches and
   worktrees, and prints one `BRANCH|` line per branch plus `COMMIT|...|UNIQUE|...`
   records for each unique residual commit.

2. **Editorial triage of the cherry-pick candidates.** Review each
   `COMMIT|...|UNIQUE|...` record — this is the LLM-judgment boundary. Confirm
   editorially that the unique commits are genuinely documentation/agent-memory
   content (for example paths under `docs/**`, `.claude/agent-memory/**`, or `**/*.md`).
   The script only reports the deterministic facts (SHA, paths, author, date); deciding
   what counts as documentation is this skill's responsibility.

3. **Consolidate onto `documentationandmemories`.** When the candidate list is
   non-empty, the script creates the `documentationandmemories` branch off `main` in a
   dedicated worktree (never the caller's worktree) and cherry-picks the flagged commits
   oldest-first per source branch, branches in `LC_ALL=C` order, with `-x` provenance. A
   pre-existing `documentationandmemories` branch stops the run with a report — never
   reuse it silently. Conflicts are aborted and surfaced as `CONFLICT` for editorial
   resolution, never auto-resolved.

4. **Push and hand off PR creation to `Agent(pr-author)`.** Push the consolidation
   branch (`git push`). Refresh the PR-context bundle with
   `mcp__drm-copilot__collect_pr_context` using base branch `main` (producing
   `artifacts/pr_context.summary.txt` and `artifacts/pr_context.appendix.txt`).
   Validate the orchestrator-state checkpoint
   (`artifacts/orchestration/orchestrator-state.json`) with `--require-pr-creation-ready`
   and record the `pr_author_preflight` result; delegation is prohibited when that
   validation fails. Then delegate PR creation to `Agent(pr-author)` per
   `.claude/skills/pr-author/SKILL.md`, using `<N> = 396` for the body-file and receipt
   contract. This skill never authors or creates the PR itself.

5. **Wait for merge and verify git-natively.** The consolidation PR's merge is
   **human-performed**: the operator merges it outside the agent session; this skill
   never issues the merge itself. This is why: `gh pr merge` is absent from this skill's
   `allowed-tools`; the project permission allow-list (`permissions.allow` in
   `.claude/settings.json`) carries no `gh` entry; and `.claude/hooks/enforce-epic-merge-gate.ps1`
   would deny the command with `EPIC_MERGE_GATE_BLOCKED` if it were attempted. At this
   boundary the agent reports the consolidation pull request's URL or number to the
   operator and stops. The ruleset on `main` sets `strict_required_status_checks_policy`,
   so the branch must be up to date with `main` before the merge becomes available to the
   operator; the wait for the merge is unbounded within a session. After the consolidation
   PR merges, verify it with `git fetch` followed by
   `git merge-base --is-ancestor documentationandmemories main`. Exit 0 confirms every
   consolidated commit is now reachable from `main`; that is the only state that unlocks
   deletion of branches whose unique content was consolidated.

6. **Run the apply-mode deletion.** Run `bash scripts/bash/cleanup-worktrees.sh --apply`.
   It re-verifies each candidate's ancestry/equivalence in-process, removes worktrees
   (without force; a dirty worktree is reported via `DIRTY|` lines and skipped), then
   deletes branches with `git branch -D`. The now-merged `documentationandmemories`
   branch and its worktree become `MERGED_CLEAN` instances and are cleaned up by the same
   mechanics. Any worktree left standing afterward — reported `BLOCKED-DIRTY`, or whose
   branch classified `NOT_MERGED` or `HAS_UNIQUE_RESIDUALS` — is not abandoned; it moves
   to the Dirty Worktree Triage Procedure below.

   A consolidation branch whose tip equals `main`, which is the state of
   `documentationandmemories` between its creation off `main` and its first commit, is
   reported `NOT_ANCESTOR` by a tip-equality pre-check that runs before any network fetch
   and is therefore not delete-eligible; the post-merge cleanup described above is
   unaffected, because a merged consolidation branch's tip differs from `main`, and an
   empty or unresolvable tip on either side is reported `ANCESTRY_ERROR` rather than
   treated as equality.

   Detached-HEAD worktrees are handled on the same terms. Apply mode classifies each on
   its own HEAD SHA, emits the five-field `WORKTREE|<path>|DETACHED|<state>|<flags>`
   record from that verdict, and acts only on the delete-eligible states `MERGED_CLEAN`,
   `MERGED_CONTENT_NEUTRAL`, and `MERGED_EQUIVALENT`. A delete-eligible detached worktree
   is re-verified in the same process immediately before the destructive action and is
   then removed without force. A locked one is skipped with the result token
   `ACTION|worktree-remove|<path>|BLOCKED-LOCKED`; the locked test reads the porcelain
   flags already in hand and precedes every git invocation, so no `git worktree remove`
   command is issued for it. A prunable one is report-only: it produces its registration
   record and no further line, with no removal and no prune. A dirty one reaches the same
   non-forced removal path as a branch-backed worktree and is reported `BLOCKED-DIRTY`
   with its accompanying `DIRTY|` lines.
   In apply mode a blocked detached removal — `BLOCKED-DIRTY`, `BLOCKED-LOCKED`, or
   `BLOCKED-REVERIFY` — sets a non-zero exit status, so a checkout holding dirty or locked
   detached worktrees exits non-zero from `--apply` where the same checkout previously
   exited 0.

## Nothing to Consolidate (Short Path)

When report mode classifies every candidate as `MERGED_CLEAN` or `MERGED_EQUIVALENT`
with an empty cherry-pick-candidate list, skip steps 3-5 entirely: proceed directly from
the report to `bash scripts/bash/cleanup-worktrees.sh --apply`. Cleanup completes in a
single session with no PR.

## Dirty Worktree Triage Procedure

**Trigger.** A worktree reported `ACTION|worktree-remove|<path>|BLOCKED-DIRTY` (with
accompanying `DIRTY|<path>|<status-porcelain-line>` records), or a branch classified
`NOT_MERGED` or `HAS_UNIQUE_RESIDUALS`, carries uncommitted or unmerged content the
script correctly refuses to discard. That refusal is correct and this procedure never
overrides it — a dirty worktree is never force-removed. This procedure is the systematic
follow-up: deciding, per worktree, whether that content is disposable or must be
preserved before the worktree can ever be deleted. Report mode now precedes this
procedure with a machine-readable first pass: one `DIRTFILE|` record per status entry
giving that entry's verdict, and one `DIRTSUM|` record per worktree giving the aggregate
`ALL_DISPOSABLE` or `HAS_UNIQUE`. Steps 1-9 below apply to the worktrees carrying at
least one `UNIQUE` verdict, which are exactly the ones the classifier could not establish
as disposable and which therefore still require human editorial judgement.

Steps 1-7 are read-only investigation. Run them per worktree, or fan out one
`Agent(general-purpose)` investigation per worktree (or small batch) concurrently per
step 8, each returning a `SAFE_TO_DELETE` / `PRESERVE` verdict with justification citing
specific files or commit SHAs, before step 9 acts on any finding.

1. **Re-verify current state before analyzing.** Worktrees can be actively in use by
   another concurrent session. Re-run `git status --porcelain` in the worktree and
   re-check the branch's merge status fresh — do not reuse the original scan's
   snapshot. If the worktree's `.git`/index/HEAD mtimes show activity in the last few
   minutes, treat it as possibly live and pause rather than analyze it as abandoned.

2. **Check committed-but-unmerged commits, not only the working tree.** Run
   `git log main..<branch> --oneline`. Some worktrees carry real commits that never
   merged, separate from uncommitted working-tree changes. Both need the classification
   in step 5.

3. **Check for equivalent content already on `main`, by topic, not only by path.** For
   every dirty, untracked, or unmerged file, check `git show main:<path>` at the same
   path, and also grep broadly across the relevant shared namespace (for example
   `.claude/agent-memory/**` for lesson files, `docs/features/**` for feature docs)
   since the same fact is often re-recorded under a different filename on `main`.

4. **For feature-folder doc snapshots** (`issue.md`, `plan.md`, `spec.md`,
   `research/*`), check whether the feature is fully closed on `main` — acceptance
   criteria all checked, code-review/feature-audit/policy-audit artifacts present, an
   evidence trail present. An earlier draft of an already-closed feature is almost
   always fully superseded; diff it against the closed feature's final artifacts to
   confirm rather than assume.

5. **Classify any content that is not obviously superseded** into exactly one of:
   - `DEAD_ONE_OFF` — real, but tied to an already-executed, closed plan with no reuse
     elsewhere (check whether the same pattern appears in shared `.claude/skills/**`
     templates or in other feature plans). Low value; safe to discard even though it is
     not technically duplicated.
   - `ALREADY_SOLVED_ELSEWHERE` — the underlying problem it documents is fixed a
     different way on `main` (check `main`'s current code/config/script, not only its
     memory files — a memory file can describe a bug that no longer exists).
   - `STALE_OR_CONTRADICTED` — `main`'s current version of the same lesson has since
     been corrected to state something different or opposite. This is not merely
     redundant; it is actively wrong, and discarding is the right call.
   - `GENUINELY_NEW` / `STILL_RELEVANT` — not found anywhere else, or it corrects
     something `main` currently gets wrong, or it documents unresolved scope on a
     still-open issue (verify open/closed with `gh issue view <n>`; never assume). Must
     be preserved before the worktree is deleted.

6. **Handle non-memory dirty content on its own terms.** Some worktrees carry stale
   build artifacts (a modified `.csproj`/`packages.config`/`app.config` from a build run
   in that worktree) rather than documentation. Diff a representative sample against
   `main` (`git diff main -- <path>`) to characterize the change before deciding it is
   disposable. The classifier scopes this class narrowly: it labels a project file
   `DISPOSABLE_BUILD_ARTIFACT` only when every changed line in that entry's diff is an
   analyzer `HintPath` rewrite. A project file whose diff touches anything else — a
   `Compile Include` registration, a package reference, a target or property change — is
   reported `UNIQUE` and is not disposable, so this step's manual characterization is
   still required for it.

7. **Recognize orphaned non-worktree directories.** A path can still exist on disk
   under a worktree-tracking folder after `git worktree remove` partially ran or
   failed, with no `.git` file inside and no entry in `git worktree list`. These are no
   longer worktrees — flag them for plain filesystem removal, not `git worktree
   remove`, which will misfire or no-op on them. Filesystem removal of an orphaned
   directory is a destructive action outside this skill's pre-approved tool surface; it
   requires explicit user confirmation each time, the same as any other irreversible
   delete.

8. **Parallelize the triage.** Steps 1-7 are pure read-only investigation. Fan out one
   `Agent(general-purpose)` investigation per worktree (or a small batch) concurrently,
   each following steps 1-7 and returning a structured `SAFE_TO_DELETE` / `PRESERVE`
   verdict with justification. This scales far better than triaging serially.

9. **Route `PRESERVE` findings through the existing consolidation flow** (the
   `documentationandmemories` branch/PR mechanism in steps 3-4 of the End-to-End
   Workflow above) before that worktree's dirty content is discarded. If a finding
   describes unresolved product scope rather than a process lesson, promote it to a
   real follow-up issue instead of folding it into the docs/memory PR: file it with
   `mcp__drm-copilot__new_potential_bug_entry` and promote with
   `mcp__drm-copilot__potential_to_issue` per
   `.claude/skills/feature-promotion-lifecycle/SKILL.md`. For a `SAFE_TO_DELETE`
   verdict, discard the content as a distinct, individually confirmed manual action —
   clear the dirty working tree, or delete a disposable `NOT_MERGED`/
   `HAS_UNIQUE_RESIDUALS` branch directly. This is never automated: the script's
   classification ladder and apply-mode allowlist are never changed to accept these
   states, so a `--apply` run never deletes them on its own, before or after triage. If
   discarding the working-tree content changes the branch's classification (for example
   to content-neutral against `main`), a follow-up report/apply pass then picks it up
   through the normal deterministic path.

   Distinguish two different discards. The sentence above governs the editorial discard
   of `UNIQUE` content — content a human judged safe to lose — and that discard stays
   manual and individually confirmed. Separately, dirt the classifier established as
   disposable, meaning a worktree whose `DIRTSUM|` aggregate is `ALL_DISPOSABLE`, can be
   cleared by the tool itself under the opt-in `--clear-disposable` flag in apply mode.
   That path never touches a `UNIQUE` verdict: one `UNIQUE` entry refuses the clear for
   the whole worktree, and a classification read that errors produces a fail-closed
   `UNIQUE` with the same effect. It is also not force-removal — it clears the working
   tree and retries the same unforced `git worktree remove` after a fresh in-process
   re-verification. The classification ladder and the apply-mode allowlist remain
   unchanged by it.

10. **After local branch deletion, check origin too.** This skill is local-only by
    design (see "When to Use This Skill"), which leaves stale branches on the remote for
    anything already merged. After `--apply` finishes, diff the deleted-local-branch
    list against `git branch -r` (post-prune) to find remote branches whose local
    counterpart is gone, and offer to delete the remainder on origin. Because this
    mutates shared, visible remote state, each deletion requires explicit user
    confirmation — never delete an origin branch as an automatic consequence of local
    cleanup, and never rely on this skill's general `Bash(git push *)` allowance to
    perform it silently.

## Prohibited Shortcuts

- Never invoke `gh pr create` or `gh pr edit --body*` from this skill or the scripts. PR
  authoring is `Agent(pr-author)`'s exclusive responsibility and is enforced by the
  `enforce-pr-author-skill.ps1` PreToolUse hook.
- Never pass a force flag to `git worktree remove`. A dirty worktree blocks deletion and
  is reported for manual handling; it is never force-removed. The `--clear-disposable`
  flag is not an exception to this rule and is not force-removal: it clears the working
  tree first and then retries the same unforced `git worktree remove`, so the removal it
  retries is the identical unforced call that was blocked. It runs only when every
  per-file verdict for that worktree is non-`UNIQUE`, only in apply mode, only when the
  operator explicitly requests it, and only after a fresh in-process re-verification that
  the branch is still delete-eligible. A single `UNIQUE` verdict refuses the clear for the
  whole worktree, including the fail-closed `UNIQUE` assigned when a classification read
  errors.
- Never execute `git worktree prune`. Prunable registrations are report-only.
- Never act on `NOT_MERGED`, `HAS_UNIQUE_RESIDUALS`, or `PROTECTED_CURRENT` candidates
  through the script or its apply-mode allowlist; `--apply` never mutates them, and the
  caller's worktree and branch, and the main worktree, are never mutated under any
  disposition. The Dirty Worktree Triage Procedure's `SAFE_TO_DELETE` verdict authorizes
  only a distinct, individually confirmed manual action outside that automated path for
  `NOT_MERGED`/`HAS_UNIQUE_RESIDUALS` — never a change to the classification ladder
  itself, and never for `PROTECTED_CURRENT`.
- Never use commit-message text matching as a classification input, and never
  auto-resolve cherry-pick conflicts.
- Never delete an origin branch, or run plain filesystem removal on an orphaned
  worktree-tracking directory, without explicit per-item user confirmation — both are
  outside this skill's pre-approved tool surface regardless of how the triage verdict
  came out.
- Never issue the consolidation merge command, and never write or edit an orchestration
  checkpoint in order to satisfy `.claude/hooks/enforce-epic-merge-gate.ps1`. This
  forecloses the specific evasion of writing an
  `artifacts/orchestration/orchestrator-state.json` whose `epic_mode` and `step9_status`
  fields the gate's child-feature accept shape would honour for any pull-request number.
- Never widen the definition of disposable dirt. The session-artifact list is a fixed
  in-script array of exactly three paths with no configuration override, no environment
  variable, and no per-repository extension point; adding a path to it is a change to the
  classifier, not a setting. The build-artifact rule requires both conditions together —
  the `*.csproj` path pattern and the content confinement that every changed line in the
  entry's diff is an analyzer `HintPath` rewrite — and a project file whose diff touches
  anything else is `UNIQUE`. Ignored files are never cleared, because they are never
  classified: `git status --porcelain` is read without `--ignored`, so an ignored file
  never becomes an entry, and `git clean` is never given `-x`, `-X`, or `-ff`.
