#!/usr/bin/env bash
# cleanup_worktrees_actions_lib.sh: sourceable function library for the mutating
# ("apply mode") half of the cleanup-worktrees tool. Provides consolidation onto the
# documentationandmemories branch (dedicated worktree creation, cherry-picking with
# conflict/empty handling, abort cleanup), the post-merge verification gate, and the
# deletion mechanics (same-process re-verification, no-force worktree removal,
# branch deletion) plus the apply-mode driver.
#
# Sourcing contract: this library depends on functions defined in
# scripts/bash/cleanup_worktrees_lib.sh (cleanup_wt_git, parse_worktree_list,
# classify_ancestry, classify_branch, run_report). The wrapper
# scripts/bash/cleanup-worktrees.sh sources that library first; the bats suites do
# the same. This file defines functions only and runs nothing at source time.
# git commands that legitimately return non-zero (cherry-pick on conflict, worktree
# remove on a dirty tree, merge-base --is-ancestor) are captured with `|| rc=$?` so
# an intended non-zero exit does not abort under set -euo pipefail. All consolidation
# git commands target the dedicated worktree via `git -C`, never the caller's tree.
#
# Guarded-read invariant: every git-backed read whose output or exit code is
# authoritative is captured in the parent shell (`out=$(cmd) || rc=$?`, iterated over
# `<<<"$out"`), never via `mapfile`/`< <(...)`. consolidation_worktree_path fails
# (non-zero, empty stdout) on a parse_worktree_list hard failure or an empty main path,
# so the malformed `-wt/documentationandmemories` derivation is impossible; both
# consumers (create_consolidation_worktree, cleanup_consolidation_on_abort) guard the
# capture. run_apply captures parse_worktree_list, enumerate_branches, and each
# classify_branch with rc up front and returns non-zero on any hard failure without
# mutating. reverify_delete_eligible and remove_worktree_safe capture their git-backed
# reads and fail closed (BLOCKED-REVERIFY / BLOCKED-DIRTY). Accepted best-effort sites
# (Design Decision 9), intentionally left as `|| true` because every failure direction
# is already fail-closed: `git fetch origin main` in verify_consolidation_merged (a
# stale main can only block deletion, never fabricate ancestry), `cherry-pick
# --skip`/`--abort` in cherry_pick_candidates (a failed skip/abort surfaces on the next
# pick as rc=1), the CHERRY_PICK_HEAD and ref-exists probes, and
# `vout=$(verify_consolidation_merged) || true` in run_apply (only the exact token
# MERGED_CLEAN unlocks deletion).
#
# Opt-in disposable-dirt clearing hook: when CLEANUP_WT_CLEAR_DISPOSABLE is 1,
# delete_candidate answers a BLOCKED-DIRTY removal by calling clear_disposable_dirt
# (scripts/bash/cleanup_worktrees_dirt_lib.sh), then re-verifying delete eligibility in
# process, then retrying the SAME unforced removal. remove_worktree_safe is unmodified
# by that hook: it gains no force flag, no new argument, and no new call site, so the
# never-force-remove invariant holds on every path. The hook is off by default, runs in
# apply mode only, and refuses the clear when any per-file verdict for the worktree is
# UNIQUE, including the fail-closed UNIQUE assigned when a classification read errors.
