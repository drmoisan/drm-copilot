.SYNOPSIS
    Pre-tool-use hook that gates git worktree remove behind parallel checkpoint merge state.

.DESCRIPTION
    Invoked by the Claude Code PreToolUse hook on the "Bash" matcher before any Bash
    command runs. Regex-matches git worktree remove against the envelope's tool_input.command,
    extracts the target worktree path argument, reads
    artifacts/orchestration/parallel-orchestrator-state.json, and finds the items[] record
    whose worktree_path matches. Allows removal only when that record's merge_status is
    merged or worktree_removed. Denies with reason PARALLEL_WORKTREE_REMOVAL_BLOCKED when
    the checkpoint is unreadable, no matching record exists, or merge_status is anything
    else - fail-closed, following the enforce-epic-worktree-removal-gate.ps1 precedent of
    treating an unreadable/no-match checkpoint as deny.

    Adapted from enforce-epic-worktree-removal-gate.ps1. The command interception regexes
    and the path normalization are unchanged; the checkpoint path, the read seam name, and
    the record collection differ, because the parallel surface records per-item state in
    items[] rather than features[]. A parallel run has no integration branch: each item
    opens its own pull request against main, so a removed worktree is unrecoverable work
    unless that item's own merge has been durably confirmed.

.NOTES
    Compatible with PowerShell 7+. No external module dependencies. Filesystem reads go
    through an injectable wrapper function so tests can mock the boundary without writing
    temporary files.

function Get-ParallelWorktreeRemovalCommandPath {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Extract the target worktree path argument from a git worktree remove command.
    .DESCRIPTION
        The operand comes from the segment that structurally invokes git worktree remove,
        so a 'cd <path> &&' segment chained before the removal contributes nothing and a
        quoted mention of the phrase resolves to no operand at all. Quotes around the path
        are already stripped by the tokenizer.

        '--force' is a zero-argument flag, so it never contributes an operand and may be
        written on either side of the target path. Its presence is read structurally through
        Test-CommandLineFlag rather than by searching the raw text, so a '--force' spelling
        that appears inside an unrelated quoted argument cannot change how the operand list
        is read. When no operand resolves, a present '--force' is reported in its place, so
        the checkpoint lookup fails closed on a value that matches no recorded worktree_path
        - the same value the previous raw-text pattern returned for that input.

        This body is identical to Get-EpicWorktreeRemovalCommandPath in
        enforce-epic-worktree-removal-gate.ps1. The two gates fire on the same command and
        now delegate the shared concern to one parser rather than to two patterns that had
        already diverged from the Codex copy.

        Acquires the payload through the shared reader unless the caller supplies
        one, emits the compact decision JSON, and returns 0. It never returns 1:
        exit 1 is non-blocking for PreToolUse, so every anomaly is already a deny
        decision by the time control reaches here. The function does not call exit;
        the thin tail converts the returned code into a process exit.
    .PARAMETER ToolInputRaw
        Optional pre-acquired payload text. When omitted the ReadPayload seam runs.
    .PARAMETER ReadPayload
        Seam for payload acquisition, so tests can drive the empty-on-all-transports
        case without touching a console.
