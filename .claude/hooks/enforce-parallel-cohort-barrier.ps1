.SYNOPSIS
    Pre-tool-use hook that is the Layer 1 per-call deterrent for the parallel cohort barrier.

.DESCRIPTION
    Invoked by the Claude Code PreToolUse hook on the "Agent" matcher before any Agent
    (Task) call runs. Activates only when the envelope's tool_input.subagent_type == "orchestrator"
    and the serialized prompt contains the parallel kickoff marker "Parallel mode: true".

    Adapted from enforce-epic-wave-barrier.ps1. The parallel surface has no depends_on
    field, so the epic hook's depends_on lookup is replaced by conflict-edge plus
    cohort-index logic: ordering is derived from blast-radius contention recorded as
    conflict_edges[], and position is read from the current cohort coloring.

    Resolution and decision procedure:
      1. Resolve the worktree whose parallel checkpoint records the prompt's
         parallel_slug: value (issue #690) and deny an unresolved or ambiguous target.
      2. Collect the cited feature-folder candidates with the shared resolver
         (feature-folder-resolution.ps1, issue #565): every docs/features/active/<token>
         path is truncated to its feature-folder segment, so a nested research/ or
         evidence/ citation names its own folder. No candidate denies.
      3. Read artifacts/orchestration/parallel-orchestrator-state.json beneath that
         worktree and select the target among the candidates with
         Select-FeatureFolderTarget. The canonical issue-number line, when it names exactly
         one number, breaks a tie among the cited run items; two or more remaining
         candidates otherwise deny as ambiguous. Neither string length nor prompt position
         takes part in the selection. Then locate the items[] record whose feature_folder
         resolves to the selected basename.
      4. Project the cohort coloring to the cohorts[] rows whose generation equals the
         top-level recolor_generation, and read the target item's cohort index from that
         projection.
      5. Collect every conflict_edges[] neighbor of the target item.
      6. Deny with reason PARALLEL_COHORT_BARRIER_BLOCKED unless every neighbor that sits
         in a strictly prior current-generation cohort has merge_status in
         {merged, worktree_removed}. ci_green does NOT satisfy the barrier: an item whose
         CI is green has not merged, so its worktree is still live and its contention is
         unresolved. Same-cohort and later-cohort neighbors do not block Layer 1.
      7. A missing or unparseable checkpoint, an unresolved feature-folder token, a
         missing items[] record, a target with no current-generation cohort assignment, a
         missing neighbor record, and a missing merge_status all deny (fail-closed).

    This is the per-call deterrent (Layer 1) of the two-layer cohort-barrier design.
    Neither layer alone closes the gap: a PreToolUse hook fires once per tool call with no
    cross-call or conversation-state visibility, so it cannot validate a batch of
    concurrent Agent calls. The retrospective backstop (Layer 2) is the
    PARALLEL_COHORT_BARRIER_VIOLATION ordering invariant inside
    validate_parallel_orchestrator_state_text, enforced at parallel-orchestrator
    SubagentStop time.

.NOTES
    Compatible with PowerShell 7+. Depends on WorktreeItemResolution.psm1 and
    WorktreeRunResolution.psm1 (issue #690) and the pure sibling
    feature-folder-resolution.ps1 (issue #565), each loaded inside a guard: the first
    failure is recorded and the decision denies naming the dependency. Filesystem reads go
    through an injectable wrapper function so tests can mock the boundary without writing
    temporary files.

        Separators are normalized to forward slashes, a trailing slash is trimmed, and a

        Applied to both sides of the target comparison so a checkpoint that records a full
