.SYNOPSIS
    Resolve the coverage thresholds that govern the feature-review coverage validation.
.DESCRIPTION
    Implements the threshold precedence of the pushed quality-tiers rule for the
    feature-review SubagentStop hook (issue #824, follow-up FU-823-1). When the
    repository's root CLAUDE.md states a line or branch coverage threshold, that threshold
    governs; otherwise the default governs (85 percent line, 75 percent branch). Each
    metric is resolved on its own, so a root CLAUDE.md that states only a line threshold
    leaves the branch default in force.

    Pure string logic only: the caller supplies the CLAUDE.md text. No disk, process,
    network, clock, or environment access. It is dot-sourced by
    validate-feature-review-coverage.ps1 as:
    . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'feature-review-coverage-thresholds.ps1')

    .SYNOPSIS
        Return the governing line and branch coverage thresholds for a root CLAUDE.md text.
    .DESCRIPTION
        For each metric M in 'line' and 'branch', a figure is read only when a comparator
        or floor phrase links it to the metric: the text must contain 'M coverage', then
        any text on the same line without a percent sign, then one of '>=', the U+2265
        sign, 'at least', 'minimum', 'minimum of', or 'no less than', an optional colon,
        and the figure followed by a percent sign. Prose such as 'line coverage was 62%
        last release' is not read. The first match whose value parses (invariant culture)
        to a number from 0 to 100 sets that metric and its source to 'claude-md'.
        Otherwise the metric keeps its default (line 85, branch 75) and its source is
        'default'.

        Known limitation: a combined statement such as 'line and branch coverage >= 70%'
        matches neither metric, because the metric name must be followed directly by
        'coverage' and must not be joined to the other metric name by 'and', 'or', '&',
        or '/'. Both metrics then keep their defaults, which is the stricter direction.
    .PARAMETER ClaudeMdText
        The text of the repository's root CLAUDE.md; $null or empty when it is absent.
