# cleanup-worktrees.sh: thin CLI wrapper for the cleanup-merged-worktrees tool. It
# classifies local branches/worktrees against main and, in apply mode only, deletes
# delete-eligible candidates and drives consolidation. All logic lives in the two
# sourceable libraries so the functions are unit-testable from bats by sourcing them
# directly; this wrapper only resolves paths, prints usage, and dispatches.

Usage: cleanup-worktrees.sh [command]

Commands:
  (no args) | report   Dry-run report (default). Classifies every local branch and
                       worktree against main and prints a deterministic, machine-
                       parseable report. Performs NO mutation of any kind.
  --apply | apply      Apply mode. Deletes delete-eligible candidates (MERGED_CLEAN,
                       MERGED_CONTENT_NEUTRAL, MERGED_EQUIVALENT) after same-process
                       re-verification, removing worktrees without force and deleting
                       branches with -D. Never acts on NOT_MERGED,
                       HAS_UNIQUE_RESIDUALS, or PROTECTED_CURRENT candidates.
  --help | -h | help   Print this help and exit 0.

Flags:
  --clear-disposable   Apply mode only, opt-in, and destructive. When a worktree removal
                       is blocked because the worktree is dirty, and every per-file
                       verdict for that worktree is disposable, the working tree is
                       cleared with reset --hard and clean -fd and the SAME unforced
                       removal is retried once after a fresh in-process re-verification.
                       Refuses the clear for the whole worktree when any per-file verdict
                       is UNIQUE, including the fail-closed UNIQUE assigned when a
                       classification read errors. Ignored files are never cleared. This
                       flag may be given before or after the apply argument; supplying it
                       without apply mode is a usage error and exits 2.

Report lines (pipe-delimited, LC_ALL=C ordered): BRANCH|<name>|<state>;
COMMIT|<branch>|<sha>|<state>|<paths>|<author>|<date>;
WORKTREE|<path>|<branch>|<flags> for a branch-backed worktree registration;
WORKTREE|<path>|DETACHED|<state>|<flags> for a detached-HEAD worktree registration,
which is classified on its own HEAD SHA and whose fifth field preserves the porcelain
locked and prunable markers; WARN|main-divergence|<local>|<origin>;
DIRTY|<path>|<status>; ACTION|<verb>|<target>|<result> (apply mode);
DIRTFILE|<worktree>|<verdict>|<detail>|<xy>|<path>, one per dirty entry in porcelain order;
DIRTSUM|<worktree>|<aggregate>|<detail>, exactly one per dirty worktree. The verdicts are
DISPOSABLE_BUILD_ARTIFACT, DISPOSABLE_SESSION_ARTIFACT, CONTENT_ON_MAIN, CONTENT_IN_HISTORY,
STAGED_TREE_IS_COMMIT, and UNIQUE; the aggregate is ALL_DISPOSABLE or HAS_UNIQUE. Both are
read-only records and neither unlocks a destructive action on its own.

Advisory, read-only records (report and apply mode; none unlocks a destructive action):
ORPHAN_DIR|<path>|<size> for a scanned directory with no .git pointer file and no
worktree registration, where <size> is best-effort and may be the literal unknown;
STALE_REF|<refname> for a refs/remotes/<name>/* ref whose <name> is not a configured
remote, in full ref form; CHILD_OF|<branch>|<ancestor> emitted alongside a branch's own
BRANCH| line when it is a git ancestor of a branch that resolved exactly NOT_MERGED;
WARN|registration-lost|<path> for a worktree whose .git gitdir pointer no longer
resolves. Deleting any of these is a manual, individually confirmed action.

Branch and detached-worktree states: MERGED_CLEAN, MERGED_CONTENT_NEUTRAL,
MERGED_EQUIVALENT, NOT_MERGED, HAS_UNIQUE_RESIDUALS, PROTECTED_CURRENT, and
ANCESTRY_ERROR. The first three are the delete-eligible allowlist; ANCESTRY_ERROR is a
hard git failure and never unlocks a destructive action.

In apply mode a blocked detached removal sets a non-zero exit status. The blocked results
are BLOCKED-DIRTY, BLOCKED-LOCKED, and BLOCKED-REVERIFY. A checkout holding dirty or
locked detached worktrees therefore exits non-zero from --apply where it previously
exited 0.

Environment overrides:
  CLEANUP_WT_GIT_BIN            Path to the git binary; an empty or nonexistent value
                               is treated as missing (falls back to PATH git). This is
                               the test-stub seam.
  CLEANUP_WT_SCAN_BIN          Path to the filesystem-scan helper; an empty or
                               nonexistent value is treated as missing (falls back to
                               the bundled cleanup_worktrees_scan_helper.sh). This is
                               the filesystem-scan test-stub seam.
  CLEANUP_WT_ORPHAN_ROOTS      Colon-separated override for the worktree-tracking roots
                               scanned for ORPHAN_DIR and WARN|registration-lost.
  CLEANUP_WT_STUB_SCENARIO     Scenario directory consumed by the checked-in git and
                               scan stubs (tests only).
  CLEANUP_WT_CONSOLIDATION_PATH Override the derived consolidation worktree path
                               (<main-worktree-path>-wt/documentationandmemories).
