# cleanup_worktrees_scan_helper.sh: the bundled real implementation behind the
# cleanup-worktrees filesystem-scan seam (CLEANUP_WT_SCAN_BIN, resolved by
# cleanup_wt_scan_bin in cleanup_worktrees_report_records_lib.sh). It performs the
# read-only filesystem observations the report-record functions need and emits them as
# one pipe-delimited tuple per candidate directory. It never writes, moves, or deletes
# anything.
#
# Usage:
#   cleanup_worktrees_scan_helper.sh scan-dirs <root-dir> [<root-dir> ...]
#
# For each <root-dir> that exists as a directory, and for each immediate subdirectory
# of that root, one record is written to stdout:
#
#   <path>|<has_gitfile>|<gitdir_target_exists>|<size>
#
#   path                 the subdirectory path as constructed from the given root.
#   has_gitfile          1 when <path>/.git exists as a regular file (the worktree
#                        pointer-file shape), else 0.
#   gitdir_target_exists NA when has_gitfile is 0 (there is no pointer to resolve);
#                        otherwise 1 when the `gitdir: <target>` line's target exists
#                        (resolved relative to <path> when the target is not absolute),
#                        else 0.
#   size                 best-effort `du -sh` size of <path>, or the literal `unknown`
#                        when du fails or prints nothing. Size is advisory only, so a
#                        du failure never fails the scan.
#
# A root that does not exist is skipped silently: an absent worktree-tracking folder is
# a normal state, not an error. Records are emitted in the shell's glob order per root;
# callers that need a total order sort the combined output themselves.
#
# Pointer-filename test seam: the pointer file's name is read from
# CLEANUP_WT_SCAN_GITFILE_NAME and defaults to `.git`, which is the only name a real
# worktree ever uses. The seam exists because git refuses to index any path component
# named `.git`, so a checked-in fixture tree cannot carry a real `.git` pointer file and
# the repository's test policy prohibits creating one at test time. The bats fixtures
# under tests/fixtures/cleanup_worktrees/scan_roots/ therefore name the pointer file
# `dotgit` and set this variable, exactly as the git-binary seam CLEANUP_WT_GIT_BIN and
# the SHELL_QC_<TOOL>_BIN seams substitute a checked-in stand-in for a real dependency.
# An empty value is treated as missing and falls back to `.git`.
