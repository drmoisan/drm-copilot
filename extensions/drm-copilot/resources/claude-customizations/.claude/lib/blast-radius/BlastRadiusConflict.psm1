.SYNOPSIS
    Mechanically-mergeable path exclusion and the shared overlap helpers.

.DESCRIPTION
    Destination-runtime PowerShell mirror of
    scripts/dev_tools/_blast_radius_mergeable.py (config_mergeable_paths,
    matches_mergeable_path, exclude_mergeable_paths), plus the two overlap helpers
    the relation calls (ports of _smallest_path_overlap and _smallest_common,
    relocated here from BlastRadius.psm1).

    The mergeable path class names the project-file shapes whose overlap a merge
    step can reconcile without re-delegating the work (issue #643). Two items
    touching the same .csproj are not genuinely in contention, so the class is
    removed from both radii immediately before the relation compares them.

    Parity notes for maintainers:
      - The exclusion is applied ONLY inside Test-BlastRadiusConflict and changes
        no radius record: a radius still lists every project file it cited, so
        drift detection and validation see the paths they saw before this key.
      - The key is optional and fail-closed: an absent mergeable_paths key and an
        empty list both exclude nothing and reproduce pre-change behaviour.
      - Every comparison is ordinal, matching the Python mirror's str equality.
    CONVENTION: this module fails fast at module scope and imports its siblings with -ErrorAction Stop.

function Get-ConfigMergeablePath {

        Read the mechanically-mergeable path list from the truth table.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Port of config_mergeable_paths. The entries name project-file shapes,
        normally anchored globs such as **/*.csproj (issue #643).

    .PARAMETER Config
        Parsed config/blast-radius.json. Only the mergeable_paths key is read.

    .OUTPUTS
        System.Object[]. Entries sorted and deduplicated by the underlying reader.
        A config with no mergeable_paths key yields an empty array.

function Test-MergeablePath {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Report whether one radius entry belongs to the mergeable path class.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Port of matches_mergeable_path. Three comparisons apply in order. The
        first two are the read-by-mandate rules, delegated to Test-MandateRead
        rather than restated: ordinal equality, the only rule that can settle a
        glob entry, then glob containment for a concrete entry only. The third is
        specific to this class, because an anchored pattern requires a separator
        and so excludes a root-level file; retesting a concrete entry with the
        anchor removed admits packages.config at the repository root.

    .PARAMETER Entry
        One radius paths entry: a concrete repository-relative path or a glob.

    .PARAMETER MergeablePath
        Configured patterns from Get-ConfigMergeablePath. An empty collection
        matches nothing.

    .OUTPUTS
        System.Boolean. True when the entry belongs to the mergeable class and is
        therefore excluded from the comparison. A glob entry is never mergeable
        unless it equals a configured pattern character for character.

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Drop every mechanically-mergeable entry from a collection of paths.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Port of exclude_mergeable_paths. The caller passes the content by value,

        sees the filtered collection.

    .PARAMETER Entry
        Radius paths entries to filter. An empty collection is accepted.

    .PARAMETER MergeablePath
        Configured patterns from Get-ConfigMergeablePath. An empty collection
        excludes nothing, so the returned content equals the input.
