<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Parses `gh pr checks` JSON into the orchestrator `ci_gate` object defined by
    Step S9 (CI Green Gate) of .claude/skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md.

.DESCRIPTION
    Consumes the JSON array emitted by
    `gh pr checks --required --json bucket,name,state,link,workflow` and produces
    the `ci_gate` object the orchestrator writes to its checkpoint. The object
    carries the five contract fields: head_sha, pr_pipeline_run_id,
    pr_pipeline_run_url, conclusion, and verified_at.

    This script is the single source of truth for `ci_gate.conclusion`
    derivation. It does NOT invoke `gh`. The orchestrator runs `gh` and passes
    the resulting JSON to this script via the -ChecksJson parameter or the
    pipeline, keeping all network/executable I/O outside this derivation step so
    the logic is deterministically testable.

    Conclusion derivation (per the documented bucket mapping):
      - Any required check with bucket 'fail' or 'cancel'  -> conclusion 'failure'
      - Else any required check with bucket 'pending'       -> conclusion 'pending'
      - Else (all checks 'pass' or 'skipping', or empty set) -> conclusion 'success'
    An empty required-check set is treated as 'success' (vacuously satisfied: no
    required check can fail or be in progress). An unrecognized bucket value is a
    fail-fast error so the parser never silently passes an enum it does not
    understand.

    The verified_at timestamp is produced through an injectable clock delegate
    (-NowProvider) so tests can assert an exact deterministic value without
    reading the wall clock.

.PARAMETER ChecksJson
    The JSON array string emitted by `gh pr checks --required --json ...`. Each
    element is expected to expose at least a `bucket` property. Accepts pipeline
    / stdin input so the orchestrator can pipe the `gh` output directly.

.PARAMETER HeadSha
    The PR head SHA the required checks were observed against. Recorded verbatim
    as ci_gate.head_sha.

.PARAMETER PrPipelineRunId
    Optional GitHub Actions run id for the PR Pipeline. Recorded verbatim as
    ci_gate.pr_pipeline_run_id (may be empty when not supplied).

.PARAMETER PrPipelineRunUrl
    Optional URL of the PR Pipeline run. Recorded verbatim as
    ci_gate.pr_pipeline_run_url (may be empty when not supplied).

.PARAMETER NowProvider
    Optional clock delegate (ScriptBlock) returning the value used for
    ci_gate.verified_at. Defaults to a UTC Get-Date formatted as ISO-8601. Tests
    inject a fixed delegate to make verified_at deterministic.

.PARAMETER AsJson
    When set, emits the ci_gate object as a JSON string instead of a PowerShell
    object. The default (object) output is convenient for in-process callers; the
    JSON output is convenient for checkpoint serialization.

.EXAMPLE
    gh pr checks --required --json bucket,name,state,link,workflow |
        ./scripts/orchestration/Invoke-CiGateParser.ps1 -HeadSha $sha

.OUTPUTS
    A PSCustomObject (or JSON string when -AsJson is set) with properties
    head_sha, pr_pipeline_run_id, pr_pipeline_run_url, conclusion, verified_at.

        <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Pure derivation of ci_gate.conclusion from a parsed required-check set.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Implements the documented bucket precedence with no I/O and no external
        calls, so it is deterministically unit-testable in isolation:
          1. Any 'fail' or 'cancel' -> 'failure'.
          2. Else any 'pending'      -> 'pending'.
          3. Else                    -> 'success'.
        'skipping' is non-blocking: it neither forces failure nor pending and
        contributes to 'success'. An empty set yields 'success' (vacuous). Any
        bucket value outside the known enum throws a fail-fast error naming the
        unrecognized value, preventing a silent pass on an unknown state.

    .PARAMETER Checks
        The parsed required-check collection (each element exposing a `bucket`
        property). May be $null or empty, which yields 'success'.

    .OUTPUTS
        One of the strings 'success', 'failure', or 'pending'.

    .NOTES
        Pure function: no filesystem, network, or `gh` access.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Wrapper that parses the checks JSON, derives the conclusion, and returns
        the ci_gate object.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Thin orchestration over the pure helpers: it parses -ChecksJson (failing
        fast on malformed JSON), normalizes the result into an array, delegates
        conclusion derivation to Get-CiGateConclusion, resolves verified_at via
        the injected clock delegate, and assembles the object via
        ConvertTo-CiGateObject. The wrapper exists to separate the impure JSON-parsing
        and clock concerns from the pure derivation logic.
