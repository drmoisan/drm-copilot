# cleanup_worktrees_dirt_lib.sh: sourceable dirt-classification function group for the
# cleanup-worktrees tool. Provides the bounded staged-tree probe
# (dirt_staged_tree_commit), the per-entry precedence ladder (classify_dirt_entry), the
# per-worktree driver that emits the DIRTFILE|/DIRTSUM| records
# (classify_worktree_dirt), and the opt-in clearing sequence (clear_disposable_dirt).
#
# Sourcing contract: this library defines functions and constants only; it never runs
# work at source time, so the wrapper and the bats suites can source it without side
# effects. It depends on cleanup_wt_git from cleanup_worktrees_enumerate_lib.sh, which
# MUST be sourced before this file. All git commands go through cleanup_wt_git so tests
# can stub the git binary via CLEANUP_WT_GIT_BIN.
#
# READ-ONLY GUARANTEE. Classification performs no index write and no object-database
# write. It reaches its staged-tree answer by comparing the existing index against
# candidate commits with `diff-index --cached --quiet`, never by materialising a tree,
# and it never redirects the index to an alternate file through the environment. Report
# mode is therefore non-mutating, which is the property
# tests/shell/test_cleanup_worktrees_dirt_clear.bats asserts by searching the stub's
# argv and environment log. Do not add a probe that writes.
#
# ONE-SIDED BOUND ASYMMETRY. Every bound and every match in this file fails in the safe
# direction. A missed match degrades an entry to UNIQUE, which makes the worktree
# HAS_UNIQUE and REFUSES the clear; the worktree is then left in place for manual
# triage, which is the pre-existing behavior. A spurious match would do the opposite and
# clear content that exists nowhere else. Every non-zero exit that carries no defined
# negative answer is therefore mapped to UNIQUE rather than advanced past.
#
# NO --ignored ON THE STATUS READ. The status read must not be given --ignored. Ignored
# files are never classified, so they are never cleared, and `clean -fd` without -x
# leaves them in place. Adding --ignored would bring build output and local tooling
# state into the classified set and, for any entry that then matched a disposable rung,
# into the cleared set. Do not add it.
#
# Git exit-code capture rule, following the sibling libraries: every git-backed read
# whose output or exit code is authoritative is captured in the PARENT shell
# (`out=$(cmd) || rc=$?`), never inside a pipeline or a process substitution, so a
# non-zero exit is observed rather than lost.
#
# TWO-WAY CLASSIFICATION OF NON-ZERO EXITS. A probe whose non-zero exit is its DEFINED
# NEGATIVE ANSWER advances the ladder: `rev-parse main:<path>` exiting non-zero means
# the path is absent from main, and `diff --quiet main -- <path>` exiting 1 means the
# contents differ. Both are rung-4 misses. A probe whose non-zero exit carries NO
# verdict is a hard read failure and maps the entry to UNIQUE: `status --porcelain`,
# `hash-object`, `log --find-object`, and `diff-index --cached --quiet` exiting above 1.
# Collapsing the two into one blanket rule would make CONTENT_IN_HISTORY unreachable.
#
# Record contract (pipe-delimited, one record per line; the file path is LAST so a path
# containing the delimiter is still recoverable):
#   DIRTFILE|<worktree-path>|<verdict>|<detail>|<status-code>|<file-path>
#   DIRTSUM|<worktree-path>|ALL_DISPOSABLE|HAS_UNIQUE|<detail>
# <verdict> is one of DISPOSABLE_BUILD_ARTIFACT, DISPOSABLE_SESSION_ARTIFACT,
# CONTENT_ON_MAIN, CONTENT_IN_HISTORY, STAGED_TREE_IS_COMMIT, UNIQUE. <detail> carries a
# commit sha for STAGED_TREE_IS_COMMIT and CONTENT_IN_HISTORY and is empty otherwise.
#   ACTION|dirt-clear|<worktree-path>|OK|REFUSED-UNIQUE|FAILED

# so the bats suites can drive these functions without the CLI wrapper.
