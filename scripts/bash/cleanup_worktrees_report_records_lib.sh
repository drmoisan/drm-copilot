# cleanup_worktrees_report_records_lib.sh: sourceable report-record function group for
# the cleanup-worktrees tool. It adds the report-mode visibility records that the
# classification ladder cannot see on its own: filesystem directories that are no
# longer registered worktrees, remote-tracking refs whose remote is gone, worktrees
# whose gitdir pointer no longer resolves, and the ancestor relationship between two
# branches that both resolve NOT_MERGED. The enumeration/protection seam
# (cleanup_wt_git, enumerate_branches, parse_worktree_list, normalize_wt_path,
# compute_protected, check_main_freshness) lives in cleanup_worktrees_enumerate_lib.sh
# and the classification ladder (classify_branch) lives in cleanup_worktrees_lib.sh;
# both MUST be sourced before this file. Keeping these records in a sibling file keeps
# every file within the 500-line cap.
#
# Sourcing contract: this library defines functions only; it never runs work at source
# time, so the wrapper and the bats suites can source it without side effects.
#
# Report line contract added by this library (pipe-delimited, LC_ALL=C ordered, one
# record per line; all four are advisory/read-only and never unlock a destructive

#                                            <size> is best-effort and may be the
#                                            literal `unknown`.
#   STALE_REF|<refname>                      a refs/remotes/<name>/* ref whose <name> is
#                                            not a configured remote. <refname> is the
#                                            full ref form (refs/remotes/...).

#                                            ancestor of <ancestor>, and BOTH resolved
#                                            exactly NOT_MERGED through their own

	# NO LADDER RUNG IS EVER SKIPPED, and no branch's verdict is ever derived from another
	# branch's verdict. Ancestry determines a branch's state in neither direction:
	#
	#   - At rung 2, a branch merged into main by a merge commit is an ancestor of main
	#     and therefore of every branch cut from a main that already contains it, while
	#     resolving MERGED_CLEAN itself.
	#   - At rung 3, a branch whose net diff against main is empty resolves
	#     MERGED_CONTENT_NEUTRAL while still being an ancestor of an unmerged branch.
	#   - At rung 5, classify_residual_commit decides each residual commit by comparing
	#     the BRANCH TIP's blob against main's. Two branches in an ancestor relationship
	#     have different tips, so the same residual commit can resolve CONTENT_ON_MAIN for
	#     one and UNIQUE for the other. That rung is the last before the verdict and
	#     cannot be derived from any ancestor's result under any topology.
	#
	# There is no sound cut point, so there is no cut. CHILD_OF is consequently an
	# informational record about a containment relationship, not a licence to skip work,
	# and the outcome-preservation invariant holds by construction: the BRANCH| line this
	# function emits is the byte-identical line classify_branch produced.
	#
	# Two-phase contract:
	#
	#   1. Classification. Every enumerated branch is classified by one classify_branch
	#      call. Its captured output is recorded verbatim and its state is read from the
	#      first BRANCH| line's third field. rc rises to the maximum return observed.
	#
	#   2. Pairwise ancestry, restricted to the NOT_MERGED set. For every ordered pair
	#      (X, Y) with X != Y where BOTH X and Y recorded exactly NOT_MERGED, probe
	#      `git merge-base --is-ancestor <X> <Y>` with the exit code captured via
	#      `|| mrc=$?`. Exit 0 means X is an ancestor of Y and appends CHILD_OF|X|Y to X's
	#      recorded lines, for the LC_ALL=C-first such Y so the record is deterministic
	#      when X has several NOT_MERGED ancestor-targets. Exit 1 means "not an ancestor".
	#      Any exit above 1 is a hard git failure: it emits no CHILD_OF record for that
	#      pair, leaves X's already-correct BRANCH| line exactly as classify_branch
	#      produced it — overwriting it would itself break the invariant above — and
	#      raises rc to at least 2 so the failure surfaces in the exit status instead of
	#      degrading silently to "not an ancestor". A hard failure of the ladder's OWN
	#      rung-2 probe is a separate, unaffected case that classify_branch still maps to
	#      BRANCH|<name>|ANCESTRY_ERROR.

	# such branches rather than n*(n-1) for n branches, and `main` needs no special
	# handling: classify_branch resolves it PROTECTED_CURRENT at rung 1, which is not
	# NOT_MERGED, so it never enters the probe set.
	#
