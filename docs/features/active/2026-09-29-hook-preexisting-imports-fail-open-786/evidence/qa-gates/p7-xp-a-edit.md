# Chunk XP-A Edit ([P7-T1])

Timestamp: 2026-10-10T00-07
Command: R-RESET P7-T1#1, #2, #3 (before XP-A production-file ordinals 1, 4, 7); candidate staging, mechanical transform, manual edits, and direct write of the nine XP-A Codex hooks in ordinal order (no Codex file is in W-CLOSURE, so rule 10(b) does not route them through R-INSTALL); R-LINES over the nine edited files; R-SCOPED over tests/scripts/claude-runtime/hook-dependency-guard-completeness.Tests.ps1
EXIT_CODE: 1
ExpectedExitCode: 1
Output Summary: section 2.2 applied to the nine XP-A hooks (PreToolUse; tail lines placed directly after the dot-source early return, before the tail try). W-VARDS: .codex/hooks/enforce-completion-consistency.ps1:62 rewritten to the literal guarded dot-source of 'enforce-completion-helpers.ps1' with its assignment deleted (ASSIGNMENT_KEPT: no). W-COND and D3: in .codex/hooks/enforce-epic-child-worktree-binding.ps1 the Test-Path condition is kept and its body becomes `try { . $contractPath } catch { Add-HookDependencyFailure -Name 'epic-child-launch-contract.ps1' -ErrorRecord $_ }` (net zero). No XP-A hook dot-sources the W-COND helper .codex/hooks/codex-epic-child-launch-attestation.ps1 (that is XP-B). The H2 modes file is not edited. No Codex W-RUNTIME row exists, and p6-special-cases.md records `FR-7.3: confirmed`, so no -Global is added. Every edited file is at most 500 lines. In the R-SCOPED run each XP-A hook (none is in W-CONVERT-HOOKS) has its six S1 to S6 repository codex rows on PASSED: lines and no repository FAILED: line; the remaining failures are XP-A mirror rows (copied in [P7-T2]), XP-B and XS rows, and W-CONVERT-HOOKS rows, as expected.

Per-hook S1 to S6 repository codex rows (PASSED / FAILED):
- .codex/hooks/check-powershell-test-purity.ps1 | 6 / 0
- .codex/hooks/check-python-test-purity.ps1 | 6 / 0

R-SCOPED totals: 488 PASSED, 110 FAILED.
