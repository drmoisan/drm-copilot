# cleanup_worktrees_preserve_lib.sh: sourceable preserve-file consolidation function
# group for the cleanup-worktrees tool. It consumes the `preserved_files[]` array of the
# manifest the cleanup-merged-worktrees skill writes, validates every record fail-closed,
# scans the incoming bytes for host-identifying tokens, re-derives each destination
# index's line-ending convention, and stages the surviving files onto the consolidation
# branch.
#
# Sourcing contract: this library defines functions only; it never runs work at source
# time, so the wrapper and the bats suites can source it without side effects. It MUST be
# sourced AFTER cleanup_worktrees_enumerate_lib.sh, cleanup_worktrees_lib.sh, and
# cleanup_worktrees_actions_lib.sh, because it calls cleanup_wt_git (defined in the
# enumeration library) and consolidation_worktree_path (defined in the actions library).
#
# Two-phase design. preserve_plan performs NO writes: it reads and validates the manifest
# and every record, verifies each source file exists, runs the host-token pre-pass,
# decides each index outcome, and emits the PRESERVE| and ACTION| records plus an internal
# plan stream. preserve_commit_plan is the only function that writes and is entered only
# when the pre-pass reported no match, which is what keeps the writing phase thin enough
# to leave in the coverage denominator rather than exclude from measurement.
#
# Seams. All git commands go through cleanup_wt_git (CLEANUP_WT_GIT_BIN); jq resolves
# through preserve_resolve_jq (CLEANUP_WT_JQ_BIN); the manifest path comes from
# CLEANUP_WT_MANIFEST_PATH, defaulting to
# artifacts/orchestration/cleanup-worktrees-manifest.json; the consolidation worktree
# resolves through consolidation_worktree_path (CLEANUP_WT_CONSOLIDATION_PATH).
#
# Nothing upstream is trusted. line_ending is always re-derived from the target's current
# bytes, and the local content scan runs on every record whose advisory result is `clean`.
# Both advisory values are compared against the local answer and a disagreement is
# reported, never obeyed.
#
# The source file is read with plain file I/O and never through git: the repository-root
# .claude/agent-memory tree is gitignored, so a git-mediated read would need a force flag.
# No cleanup_wt_git invocation in this library passes -f or --force ever.
