# Fail-Before B1 ([P1-T4], expect-fail)

Command: sh <SCRATCHPAD>/i663/run.sh p1-exempt  (R-SCOPED over tests/scripts/claude-hooks/enforce-orchestration-preimplementation-gate.CommandExemption.Tests.ps1 and tests/scripts/codex-hooks/enforce-orchestration-preimplementation-gate-command-exemption.Tests.ps1, before any production change)
EXIT_CODE: 1
ExpectedExitCode: 1
Output Summary: PassedCount 222, FailedCount 4, FailedBlocksCount 0, FailedContainersCount 0. The four failures are exactly the two `issue #663 exempts` rows in each suite (the pre-change helpers reject `<` and `>` anywhere in the line). All twelve `issue #663 denies` rows pass.

Note: the R-SCOPED runner ends with `[System.Environment]::Exit(<code>)` because a script-level `exit` statement after `Invoke-Pester` returned 0 to the parent process on this host; the printed `RSCOPED_EXIT_CODE:` and `PROCESS_EXIT_CODE:` lines record the value the parent observed.
